# Embarking on My Web Development Journey

Hello, World! I'm Sakhr, and I'm excited to share the beginning of my journey into the world of web development.

## Why Web Development?

In today's digital age, the web is where ideas come to life, businesses thrive, and people connect. As someone who has always been fascinated by technology and its power to shape our world, I've decided to dive into the exciting field of web development. My goal? To become a skilled front-end developer capable of creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites and applications.

## My Background and Motivation

While my background isn't in traditional computer science, I've always had a passion for problem-solving and creativity. I believe these skills, combined with my determination to learn, will serve me well in my web development journey. I'm particularly drawn to front-end development because it sits at the intersection of logic and design, allowing me to exercise both my analytical and creative muscles.

## What I'm Learning

Currently, I'm focusing on the fundamental building blocks of web development:

1. **HTML**: The backbone of web content
2. **CSS**: The styling that brings websites to life
3. **JavaScript**: The programming language that adds interactivity and functionality

I'm also learning about version control with Git and GitHub, which is helping me understand how developers collaborate and manage their code.

## My Learning Approach

I believe in learning by doing. That's why I'm:

- Taking online courses and tutorials
- Building small projects to apply what I've learned
- Participating in coding challenges
- Exploring open-source projects on GitHub

## Future Goals

As I progress in my learning, I aim to:

1. Build a robust portfolio of web projects
2. Contribute to open-source projects
3. Collaborate with other developers on meaningful projects
4. Eventually, land my first job as a junior front-end developer

## Let's Connect!

I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers, whether you're just starting out like me or you're an experienced pro. If you have any advice, resources to share, or if you'd like to collaborate on a project, please don't hesitate to reach out!

You can find me on GitHub as [sakke82](https://github.com/sakke82) or drop me an email at tamsna_sakhr@yahoo.fr.

Here's to the exciting journey ahead! ðŸš€
